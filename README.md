# CCrook-Homework1

I started the project by organizing the html into sections via comments to make it easier to read. 
I took a look at style.css and noticed that a few lines had missing apostrophes for 'Calibri' and corrected this. 
changing the Search Engine Optimization div element that had mistakenly put a class tag instead of an id tag. This allowed the css to work properly. 
I then noticed that the link in the header for Search Engine Optimization wasn't working correctly, so I fixed this. 
I added alt tags on all img elements on the site. 
I made the site's title the service's name. 
Added favicon.
